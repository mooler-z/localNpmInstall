## Local npm installer

    The internet was cut off in the place I am in
    and since I was working with nodejs, I didn't want to
    be copying packages from my already downloaded global
    packages because when I share the projects I want the
    end user to just simply npm run the project

The script **HEAVILY** relies on recursion and the rest is details.

```sh
python3 dependencies.py
```

The prompt is pretty intuitive!
